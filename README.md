# Go

This repo is a collecton of go code I wrote while working through [The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440/ref=asc_df_0134190440/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312128454859&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=17010129884021683951&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028250&hvtargid=aud-801381245258:pla-434200141853&psc=1)

## Server
The go language has a robust standard library that supports building microservices and devops tools quickly. Go is the "GOTO" language of choice if you need to build a tool quickly that compiles down to native. The code found in [Server](./Server) demonstrates:

- wiring up stdin/stdout of child processes and marshaling data between them
- Building a quick down and dirty web service to handle multiple use cases
- Embedding static resources into a single binary
